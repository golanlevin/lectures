### Poetic Computation, Creative Coding

Zachary Lieberman, in IdN *Interaction Issue* (December 2012), describes the challenge of making art by writing software as follows:

### Computing, Outside a School of Computer Science

* How many of you have taken a computer science course? More than one course?
* As curious and creative people (inventors, artists, designers, musicians, etc.), in what ways have such courses disappointed you?

Designer/educator/engineer, [Leah Buechley](http://leahbuechley.com/), has observed that STEM subjects generally fail to educate students who:

* learn *concretely* (from examples) rather than *abstractly* (from equations)
* work *improvisationally* rather than by *planning* everything in advance
* are interested in creating *expressive* objects, rather than *utilitarian* solutions.

Of traditional computer science introductions, educator-innovator Mitch Resnick has remarked, "It's like offering a writing class that teaches only grammar and punctuation without provideing students a chance to write their own stories."

![Mitch Resnick quote](images/resnick_quote.jpg)

**This class is intended to address that.**

It's possible that STEM education might benefit from the inclusion of arts-oriented pedagogic approaches. But that’s not the problem that concerns us in *this* room. Instead, in a world in which computing now touches every discipline, it should no longer be taken for granted that *computing must be taught by computer scientists*. Computer Science is a *discipline*, but programming is a *skill* (or a tool, or a medium, or better yet, a *craft*) which has different communities of use with different pedagogic needs. 

**“Creative coding”** describes the growing set of cultural practices by which artists, designers, architects, and poets employ computer programming and custom software as their chosen medium. This burgeoning field has been accelerated by the widespread adoption of open-source arts-engineering toolkits, such as Processing, p5.js, and openFrameworks, into the curricula of hundreds of art and design schools around the world. Created *by artists, for artists*, these toolkits are specifically oriented to the needs and working styles of cultural practitioners, and have radically democratized software development as a potent mode of creative inquiry. 

* Our objective is to make stirring and provocative new forms of culture.
* Our medium is software.
* We learn codecraft as necessary to execute our ideas.

We don't need much in order to make something powerful:

We can learn by hands-on tinkering and experimentation:

Also, *it takes a while:*

The tools we are using were made by artist-educators who care a great deal to improve the experiences of new learners. They have made lots of great resources to help you, including written documentation and video tutorials. 

**Here are some of those people:**

* Here is Casey Reas and Ben Fry explaining the Processing [mission statement](https://vimeo.com/28117873) in 2011.
* Lee McCarthy [speaking at the 2017 Gray Area Festival about the origin of p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1qeNMXccvA&amp;t=1831s), a sibling project that is also part of the Processing family of tools. (View from 30:30–37:30)
* Zach Lieberman [interviewed by Verse](https://twitter.com/verse_works/status/1688889255995609088), 2023. (5 minutes)

**Also:** 

* See *CLOUDS.app*
* Here is [Lauren McCarthy introducing p5.js](http://hello.p5js.org/)
* There are countless pitfalls waiting to bite you in the ass. Here's Zach Lieberman discussing [what can go wrong](https://vimeo.com/47203759?t=38m22s) (Jump to 38:22).

## Viewings 


### Some exemplary recent works of poetic computing

Unlike large Pixar productions with hundreds or sometimes thousands of credits, nearly all of these projects were created by just one or two individuals. This is often made possible (in part) by leveraging the strengths of open-source software toolkits for the arts. 

One defining characteristic of work that we can make with code is that it can be **interactive**: it can respond in a *unique* and *open-ended way* to its visitor/participant/observer. 

* Scott Snibbe, [*Boundary Functions*](https://www.snibbe.com/digital-art#/projects/interactive/boundaryfunctions/), 1998
* Camille Utterback & Romy Achituv, [Text Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_u3sSffS78), 1999
* Christine Sugrue, [*Delicate Boundaries*](http://csugrue.com/delicateboundaries/), 2007
* Camille Scherrer, [*Le Monde Des Montagnes*](https://vimeo.com/49153795), 2008
* Chris O'Shea, [*Hand from Above*](https://vimeo.com/7042266), 2008
* Karolina Sobecka, [*Sniff*](https://karolinasobecka.com/Sniff), 2011
* Theo Watson & Emily Gobeille, [*Weather Worlds*](http://design-io.com/projects/WeatherWorlds/) (2013); [*Connected Worlds*](https://vimeo.com/13158551) (2015)
* Zachary Lieberman, [*Más Que la Cara*](https://vimeo.com/211271693), 2016
* Madeline Gannon, [*Mimus*](https://atonaton.com/mimus/), 2016, and [Two Circles](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq-9RyouK-G/?img_index=1), 2023

Another defining characteristic of code as an artistic medium, is that it can be **generative**. We "*make a thing that makes a thing*": 

* Kate Compton, [*Puppets*](http://www.galaxykate.com/apps/unpublic/puppet/index.html), 2017
* Melissa Wiederrecht, [*Take Wing*](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/19456), 2022
* Michael Chang, [*Generative Machines* Chrome Experiment](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513075153/http://machines.chromeexperiments.com/)
* FIELD.io (Vera-Maria Glahn and Marcus Wendt), [Communion](https://vimeo.com/28227109), 2011
* Matthias Dörfelt, [*Munching*](https://www.mokafolio.de/works/Munching), 2014
* Nervous System (Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenburg): [generative jigsaw puzzles](https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/projects/albums/generative-jigsaw-puzzles/); [*Cell Cycle* custom ring](https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/cellCycle/?t=0); [*Kinematics Dress*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EK9MBJiFXU) 
* Lia, [*Filament Sculptures*](https://vimeo.com/85913081), 2013

*Madame Curie* by Jennifer Steinkamp

New media works can also function as self-standing artworks, public installations, provocations, apps. and much more:

* Jacob Tonksi, [*Balance from Within*](https://vimeo.com/72826106), 2014
* Mouna Andraos & Melissa Mongiat, [*21 Balançoires*](https://vimeo.com/40980676), 2012
* Helen Evans & Heiko Hansen (HeHe), [*Nuage Vert*](http://hehe.org2.free.fr/?language=en), 2012
* Markus Kayser, [*Solar Sinter*](https://kayserworks.com/#/798817030644/), 2011
* Lauren McCarthy, [*Social Turkers*](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/Social-Turkers) and [*LAUREN*](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/LAUREN)
* Miranda July, [*Somebody* app](https://vimeo.com/105256055)
