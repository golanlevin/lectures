### Unusual Historical Clocks

(*These examples taken from: [A Minor History Of / Time without Clocks](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/29/foer.php) by Joshua Foer.*)
Joshua Foer has done such an excellent job, it is best just to link to his [*A Minor History of Time Without Clocks*](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/29/foer.php). Here’s a [PDF backup](http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/resources/foer_time_without_clocks.pdf). Let’s pay special attention to the following:

* 1600’s Cannon Alarm Clock. 
	* *"The cannon dial, also known as the noonday gun, is the first natural timekeeper with an alarm setting. It consists of a small cannon and a lens mounted on a horizontal dial. As the sun passes through high noon, its rays are concentrated through the precisely positioned magnifier, igniting a small amount of gunpowder and setting off the gun."*
   ![](images/cannon_clock_foer_joshua_003.jpg)
* 1728 Sawai Jai Singh’s 90-foot tall sundial, accurate to 2 seconds:
	* ![](images/singh_029_foer_joshua_006.jpg)
* 1733 Moon Dial at Cambridge University, read by the shadow of the moon:
	* *"In addition to the traditional solar hours, the timepiece has an accompanying table that can be used to read the shadow cast by the moon. Even with the table, however, a series of four mathematical calculations has to be carried out by anyone wishing to know the time."* 
	![](images/moondial_029_foer_joshua_007.jpg)
* 1751 Linnaeus’s flower clock, read from the opening of flowers. 
	* *"Linnaeus notes in his Philosophia Botanica that if one possessed a sufficiently large variety of aequinoctal species, it would be possible to tell time simply by observing the daily opening and closing of flowers."*
	![](images/linnaeus_029_foer_joshua_008.jpg)
* 1929 Kleinhoonte's “aktograph”, or bean leaf movement clock:
	*  *"Dutch botanist Anthonia Kleinhoonte employs a measuring device known as the “aktograph” to precisely record the rhythms of a bean leaf’s movement throughout the day. A thin filament attached to the leaf is connected to a stylus, which draws on a revolving smoke drum. As the leaf rises in midday, so too does a line rise on the drum, only falling back as the leaf begins to slump in the evening. Her measurements demonstrate that the plant lives according to a strict daily rhythm".*

### 12 is Arbitrary!

It’s worth remembering that the convention that we use 12 (or 24) hour time is *totally arbitrary* — an artifact of ancient Egyptian astronomy. Other systems have been used and proposed. For example, until quite recently, a six-hour day was used in Thailand. During the French Revolution, when the metric system was invented, people seriously proposed decimal time. 

Here’s a decimal clock from the late 1700s:<br />

We see this again in the *10-Hour Flux Clock* by George Maciunas (1969):<br />

### Software Clocks (I)

Let’s begin with something simple. The [Colour Clock](http://www.thecolourclock.com/) displays the current time as a hexadecimal color. Hours = red, minutes = green, seconds = blue. There you go. In case you were wondering, more than several people have thought of this idea. Low hanging fruit.

Here's another very simple clock, [*hms*](https://www.gysin-vanetti.com/hms/) by Andreas Gysin (2010), which maps the time to the dimensions (lwh) of a rectangular solid. The piece can be seen [live online here](https://www.gysin-vanetti.com/hms/)<br />![gysin-hms.gif](images/gysin-hms.gif)

Much of this kind of investigation began with John Maeda’s highly influential [*12 O’Clocks*](http://www.maedastudio.com/2004/rbooks2k/twelve.html) software from 1996. [Here’s a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA_UTUvC4h8&t=240s) (jump to 4’00”), and here are individual GIF recordings: [maeda-01](images/maeda/maeda-01.gif), [maeda-02](images/maeda/maeda-02.gif), [maeda-03](images/maeda/maeda-03.gif), [maeda-04](images/maeda/maeda-04.gif), [maeda-05](images/maeda/maeda-05.gif), [maeda-06](images/maeda/maeda-06.gif), [maeda-07](images/maeda/maeda-07.gif), [maeda-08](images/maeda/maeda-08.gif), [maeda-09](images/maeda/maeda-09.gif), [maeda-10](images/maeda/maeda-10.gif), [maeda-11](images/maeda/maeda-11.gif), [maeda-12](images/maeda/maeda-12.gif)<br />![maeda-all.gif](images/maeda/maeda-all.gif)

This is a collection of 24 typographic clocks: sequences of numbers, letters or punctuation marks animated in different ways to express the time.

Clocks have been an *idee fixé* in new media. Here's the elegant video-slitscan-based [*Last Clock*](https://vimeo.com/27975734), (2002) by Jussi Angesleva & Ross Cooper:<br />[![](images/lastclock2-620x527.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/27975734)

### Crowdsourced Clocks

[*All the Minutes*](http://alltheminutes.com/) by Studio Moniker, is a clock which cites tweets that mention the current time.<br />
[![](images/all-the-minutes.gif)](http://alltheminutes.com/)

The [Human Clock](http://www.humanclock.com/) is a clock made from crowdsourced photographs that feature the current time.<br />
[![](images/1231.jpg)](http://www.humanclock.com/)

A well-known ‘crowdsourced’ clock (in a different sense) is Christian Marclay’s [*Clock*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gSwtr3E4Fo), a 24-hour film made up of about seven thousand clips, each of which either says or displays the (actual) time of day, or which makes a cogent reference to time:

* [*The Rhythm Of Heart*]() - A metronomic archive of the artists’ heartbeats.
* [Untitled (Perfect Lovers)](https://collections.dma.org/artwork/5324909) - by Félix González-Torres. Two synchronized clocks embody the tension that comes from two people living side-by-side as life moves forward towards death.

In some situations, it may not be necessary for a clock to “work” mechanically in order for it to “operate” powerfully. Below are clocks which are frozen at 8:15am, the moment when the Hiroshima bomb detonated, when Kengo Nikawa’s pocketwatch stopped forever.
[![](images/hiroshima-clocks-620x300.jpg)]()

In another situation, a clock may simply be working so slowly that it never appears to be working in our lifetime. The *Clock of the Long Now*, designed to last 10,000 years, ticks once per year and chimes once per century. As such, it fosters long-term thinking and remains an important symbol of hope for the future.
