### Mark-Making is Intuitive

> Today's particular focus: Not drawings *of* things, but drawing as an exhilarating act.

### Performed Imagery

The performance of live imagery has a long history. VJing!

[Mary Hallock-Greenwalt](http://amy-alexander.com/projects/online-communities/the-mary-hallock-greenewalt-visibility-project.html) (1871 – 1950) *"was an artist/inventor who was active during the first half of the 20th century. After beginning her career as a concert pianist, she became interested in the performance of light and color in addition to music. She went on to design and perform custom electric visual instruments that displayed colored light."* She called her instrument the *Sarabet*, and she called the medium of temporal light, "Nourathar". In the course of making her instruments she invented and patented the rheostat (dimmer) and the mercury tilt-switch.

*"Digit" is a live performance that is also conceived to be presented as a piece of living art. A writer sits at a table writing a text. Simply by sliding his finger over a blank piece of paper, printed text appears under his finger. The spectators can come very close to the 'writer' and read the text following the movement of the finger.*

*In this project, the robotic arm mimics the artist’s gesture by seeing through an overhead camera, and analyzing the movement through computer vision software. The result is a synchronicity of movement between artist and machine, captured as a drawing artifact.*

*You Are Here* tracks and displays the paths of people traveling through a large public space. The system displays the aggregate paths of the last few hundred visitors overlaid with blobs representing the people currently being tracked. A viewer may scroll backwards in time, revealing where she came from and how her path intersected with others.

### Graffiti Technologies

Technologies which enable artists to deploy drawings at new scales, in difficult-to-access locations, beyond the limits of their bodies.

### Audiovisual Drawing Systems

Creating sound and imagery simultaneously.

Laurie Spiegel at Bell Labs created *VAMPIRE* (Video and Music Program for Interactive Realtime Exploration), a performance system for the simultaneous synthesis of video images and electronic sound. Spiegel’s system built on the GROOVE computer music system created by Max Matthews, by combining it with paintprogram-like graphic algorithms by Kenneth Knowlton. The VAMPIRE system offered realtime, gestural control of both sound and video image, through a variety of continuous input
devices.

### Student Project: *Human Lines* by Akiva Krauthamer

[Akiva Krauthamer](http://www.akivadesign.com/default.html) was an undergraduate in the CMU School of Drama who took our *Interactive Art* advanced studio course in 2016. For his final project, he created [*Human Lines*](http://golancourses.net/2016/akiva/04/28/human-lines/), a system which used a performer's speech and body to create drawings in space. His three key inspirations were:
 
1. 20th century Bauhaus choreographer, Oskar Schlemmer<br />
![](images/schlemmer.jpg)
2. William Forsythe, [*Improvisation Technologies*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=6X29OjcBHG8) (1995)<br />

 * [William Forsythe, example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=cqGyFiEXXIQ)
3. Chris Schmandt, [*Put that There*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyBEUyEtxQo) (1979)<br />
[![](images/put-that-there.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyBEUyEtxQo)

Akiva's [*Human Lines*](http://golancourses.net/2016/akiva/04/28/human-lines/) project uses the Kinect skeleton tracking and real-time speech-to-text to enable voice-created lines on the body:<br />
