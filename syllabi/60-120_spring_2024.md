# TLDR

Your official grade will be based on your professionalism in completing work and attending class.

1. **Do The Assignment Checklists.** Each assignment has a clearly defined list of tasks, whose purpose is to help you develop discipline in documenting your work well. 
2. **No Ghosting.** Attendance is important, but if you need to miss class — which happens — just be responsible about communicating with the professor about your absence.

# Overview

### Course Description

*Foundations: Digital Media* (60-120) is a practical introduction to expanded modes of creative practice made possible by the computer. In this studio course, you will develop the skills and confidence necessary to produce interactive, generative, and immersive artworks; discuss your work in relation to current and historic praxes of electronic art; and engage new technologies critically. Topics will include no-code and low-code approaches to: internet art, immersive world-building, and environmental storytelling; generative art and experimentation with learning machines; creative interventions and performance in social platforms; and the development of branching narratives and games.


### Learning Objectives

In this course you will:

* Develop familiarity with a wide range of contemporary artists that use digital media and the Internet as core components of their practice.
* Learn the foundations of coding for visual applications.
* Be introduced to working with 3D assets and real-time 3D pipelines.
* Acquire practical and conceptual tools that can enrich and extend non-digital art practices.
* Learn concepts and strategies that will allow you to take advanced classes in Electronic and Time-Based art at CMU.

### Projects

This semester, our course will have projects linked to 5 main units: 

1. **Machine Learning:** experimentation new tools for image synthesis and recognition (using e.g. *Midjourney*) 
2. **Creative Coding:** very elementary introduction to programming, to create generative and interactive drawing tools (using *p5.js*)
3. **Interactive Narrative:** hypertextual interactive storytelling (using *Bitsy*)
4. **Audiovisual Environment:** development of a real-time, immersive audiovisual environment (using *TouchDesigner*)

Additionally, on approximately five occasions this semester, you will be asked to write brief *Looking Outwards* reports on projects (by others) that you have researched. More information on the structure of *Looking Outwards* reports [can be found here](looking-outwards.md).

# Attendance Policies

### Summary of Attendance Policies

* An *excused absence* is one about which you have communicated with me in a timely and professional manner. There is no policy limit on your number of excused absences. However, you are responsible for information you have missed; per [CMU policy](https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/assets/attendance-flexibility-11-6-2019.pdf), "faculty are not obligated to re-teach material due to a student missing class."
* Ghosting is expressly prohibited. Your first *No-Call, No-Show* event will reduce your final grade by one letter (A→B).
* Your second *No-Call, No-Show* event will cause you to fail the class (B→R).

### Excused Absences

Your presence and civic participation are of paramount importance. That said, I also recognize that students may occasionally need to miss class for a variety of reasons (e.g. illness, religious observance, job interview, family emergency, etc.). The attendance policy for this course is simple: 

**If you are unable to attend a class session, send a message to me prior to Roll Call.** You may message me by email, Discord, Twitter, or text message. Generally Roll Call is 5-10 minutes into class. My phone number is provided in the #key-information channel of our class Discord. 

I can be extremely understanding and accommodating about planned and necessary absences, family circumstances, and/or medical issues when you inform me in a timely and professional manner. Such absences will have no impact on your final grade. 

When you send me a message informing me of an upcoming absence, I don't need to know the detailed reason. It is courteous and sufficient to offer a general explanation, such as "I'm not feeling well".

If you must miss a significant number of sessions, please come and discuss the issue with me; I would like to try to find a way to support you. There is no specific limit on the number of allowable excused absences, but if you miss too many sessions, your ability to satisfactorily complete required classwork (and thus, your grade) will inevitably suffer.

I don't require notification if you just need to step out for a few minutes in the middle of class (e.g. to use the restroom, collect yourself, take an urgent call, etc.)

You are responsible for what happens in class whether you’re here or not. Organize with the me and/or your classmates to get class information and material that you have missed. If I am informed of your absence with more than one hour's notice, I *may* be able to help you by recording/streaming my presentation; however, please note that I offer no guarantees about this.

### *No-Call, No-Show* Absences

If I (the Professor) am unable to come to class, I will send a message so that students can plan accordingly. I expect the exact same courtesy from you. Failing to communicate responsibly about your absences — in other words, *ghosting*, or "[**No-Call, No-Show**](https://myhours.com/articles/no-call-no-show-policy-template-what-is-it-and-how-to-create-one)" events — is not acceptable in this course, and subject to the following policy:

* **Your first *No-Call, No-Show* event will reduce your semester grade by one letter (A→B).**
* **Your second *No-Call, No-Show* event will cause you to fail the class (B→R).**

There are very few situations in which a person is *literally unable* to send a brief message. That said, the following list of incapacitating emergencies (of you or a loved one) are—of course—acceptable excuses for a *No-Call, No-Show* absence:

* Death of a family member, loved one, or friend
* Serious injuries or accidents that pose a high risk to wellbeing
* Hospitalization
* Physical assault
* Police arrest
* Housefire

Students are responsible for notifying the professor as soon as possible, even in a justified *No-Call, No-Show* situation — i.e. a delayed notice of absence. Depending on the severity of the situation, the notice period should not exceed three days from the day of absence.

### A Word About Absences On Critique Days
Sometimes, students who haven’t completed their projects choose to skip class during critiques, because they are too embarrassed to come to class empty-handed. This type of absence is stupendously self-destructive. Please have courage. Your participation on critique days is essential, even if your own project is incomplete or missing, because these sessions and conversations help you understand our class standards, expectations, and criteria for good work. If you are empty-handed, just say so; it happens. Even if you are without a project, you are still expected to contribute productively to the class discussion. 

### Maintaining Mental Presence 
Focus is precious. Physical presence means nothing if you’re “checked out”; your *mental* presence is extremely important. During the professor’s lectures or guest presentations, distracted participation is prohibited. You are expected to be able to function for a few hours without sleeping, texting, emailing, chatting, or doing work for other courses. Additionally, your own distraction is demoralizing to those around you. If I observe you doing these things, depending on the circumstance, I may have no choice but to correct you publicly.

# Grading and Evaluation Rubrics

### Grades and/versus Evaluations

In this course, you will receive both **Grades** and **Evaluations**. 

* **Grades** are based on simple, intersubjectively observable facts about your professionalism. Did you complete all of the supporting documentation requirements for each project? Did you communicate with the professor in a timely way about your absences? Your Grades are not based on whether your work was brilliant — only whether you completed the required tasks faithfully and responsibly. 
* **Evaluations** are based on subjective assessments (opinions) of the quality of your work and other contributions. These evaluations may come from the professor, your peers, group critiques, external professional critics, or some combination of these. 

*Theoretically*, Grades and Evaluations are separate. It is possible to receive a Grade of "A" in this course (*congratulations: you ticked all of the boxes*) while making work that has been Evaluated as "B" (satisfactory) or even "C" (mediocre). In practice, however, professionalism and artistic quality are often correlated. Your evident care (or lack of it) is evident.

You might ask, "If these 'Evaluations' aren't my actual Grade, do they matter?" *That depends on you.*


### Grading Rubrics

This section discusses how your work will be *Graded*. Your Grades are entered into CMU's S3 system and appear on your official transcript.

Projects always have a list of *supporting requirements*. These are straightforward to fulfill, but if you fail to meet these fully, you will have points deducted from your grade. Nearly every Project assignment will ask you to document your work clearly and thoroughly, with tasks such as, e.g.:

* Write a one-sentence description of your project. What *is* it?
* Include a documentation image of your project, such as a screenshot or photograph
* Include scans or photos of any notebook sketches, if you have them
* In the case of dynamic work, include dynamic documentation: such as by linking to a YouTube video, or embedding an animated GIF
* Write 100-200 words about your project, describing its development process. In your writing, include some critical reflection and analysis of your project: In what ways did you succeed, and in what ways could it be better?
* (This list is representative, and not exhaustive)

Related to our course policies on Academic Integrity (see below), you must also:

* Name any other persons from whom you received advice or help. If you had collaborators, explain how the work was distributed among the collaborators.
* Cite and link to the sources for any media (e.g. code, photographs, soundtracks, source images, custom tools), created by other people, which you used in your Project. Citing your sources is *super-important,* folks; err on the side of generosity.

Your evident care and diligence in fulfilling the stated checklist(s) will be straightforwardly graded. Be sure to pay careful attention to seemingly trivial requirements. Your final grade will be derived from your various sub-grades, as apportioned below, less any demerits due to unexcused absences or lateness. 

* **Projects:** 
  1. Machine Learning Unit: 20%
  2. Creative Coding Unit: 20%
  3. Interactive Narrative Unit: 20%
  4. Audiovisual Environment Unit: 20%
* **Other Assignments:** 10%
* **Participation:** 10%

The "Participation" sub-grade is not meant to be a cudgel for introverts, but rather a vehicle for recognizing and rewarding students whose demeanor, *esprit de corps*, wherewithal, and civic effort (such as helping others, providing thoughtful feedback, etc.) improves the classroom experience for everyone. This is not about "how many times did you raise your hand?", but instead "did you help our class run smoothly?"


### Evaluation Rubrics 

This section discusses how your work will be *Evaluated*. Evaluations reflect my professional opinion of your work, as well as (potentially) the opinions of your peers or external guest critics.

The purpose of the open-ended Projects is to provide well-circumscribed opportunities for you to make creative work. Generally the Project prompts will invite you to explore a specific conceptual theme or set of technological workflows, but, unless stated otherwise, there is no correct solution, and no specific requirement for how to implement your idea. A Project also asks not just for a creative solution, but also for some creativity in defining and approaching the problem. It is expected that your Projects will be presented and documented in the appropriate channels of our class Discord server.

Your Projects will be evaluated according to the following considerations:

* **Curiosity**: Are you asking questions as you work?
* **Tenacity**: Are you forging through difficult problems without giving up?
* **Execution**: Are you crafting with purpose, precision, and attention?
* **Inventiveness**: Are you discovering/exploring methods outside the obvious and predictable?
* **Fulfillment**: Did you meet all of the requested supporting criteria (such as providing scans of sketches, writing an evaluation of your project, documenting your process, etc.)?

In short: you are invited to make interesting, novel, provocative work that’s well-crafted, and document it well. Note that with creative projects, it may not matter how much time a student spent making it. You will sometimes see a quickly-executed solution succeed because of its strong concept. Usually, however, the quality of a project is improved by extra attention to its craft.

On occasion, evaluation feedback may be accompanied by scores of S,A,B,C,D, or F, as follows:

* **S** (Surpassing/秀): You made something exceptional
* **A** (Excellent): You made something very good
* **B** (Good): You made something satisfactory, that fulfills all requirements
* **C** (Needs Improvement): You tried to make something 
* **D** (Unacceptable): You did not really try; the work does not fulfill any requirements completely
* **F** (No Credit): You did not even try, and made no arrangements to address this.

In addition to your projects, your participation will also be evaluated. There are a few essential things you can do to ensure that you receive a totally respectable Evaluation in this course:

* **Be respectful of our social space**. Make space for others.
* **Be good**. Have a positive attitude.
* **Be present**. Show up to all of the course sessions, alert and on time.
* **Be responsible**. Communicate with your professor about any issues you're encountering, and clean up after yourself.
* **Ask for help**. If you don’t know how/where/what, ask for help.
* **Be curious**. If you don’t understand something, start with curiosity rather than judgment. Curiosity and criticality go hand in hand.

Here are some things you can do to earn a really ***great*** Evaluation in this course:

* Be fearless and resourceful about getting the assistance you need.
* Help your classmates when they’re stuck.
* Make helpful contributions to discussions.


### Follow Your Passion
*This is art sqool.* With very rare exceptions (I’ll be clear), I will always prefer that you make the assignment interesting to you — if necessary, by creatively bending the rules or re-interpreting the assignment. My assignments are starting-points, prompts and propositions. Think beyond them.

Notwithstanding the above, you will always be expected to fulfill a checklist of basic tasks in regards to deliverables and documentation. Did you include the requested screenshot of your project, etc.? These expectations will always be clearly listed.


### Policies for Late Work
When you submit a project late, you miss the chance to share, discuss and get feedback on your work. These are some of the most valuable affordances of this class.

At times this semester, your creative projects may be reviewed by your peers or even by outside guests. If your assignment is not uploaded and documented online in time for these reviews, then your work will officially be considered “too late” and may not be able to earn full credit.

* Generally I grade work a few days after the due date. *I offer no precise details about this*. Needless to say, it inconveniences me to grade late work that is submitted after I conclude my grading; I need to focus on new business.
* Projects submitted after critiques may not receive written feedback, or may only receive significantly attenuated written feedback. 

For minor projects (such as *Looking Outwards* blog posts): These should be uploaded and completed by the time that I get around to grading them, which is usually a day or two after their stated due date. If not, I reserve the right to assign partial or zero credit to them.

# Academic Integrity
Your behavior as a responsible member of the new-media arts community is very important — as demonstrated, for example, by properly citing your sources, and crediting those who have helped you. These expectations and obligations are addressed here, in our course Academic Integrity Policy.

### Summary of CMU Academic Integrity Policies
Carnegie Mellon University prohibits academic dishonesty. This includes plagiarism, and may consist of: submitting the work of someone else as one’s own; failing to cite assistance you received; or the failure to properly cite materials or ideas from other sources. Nearly all of these problems can be circumvented if you’re clear and generous in giving credit where credit is due. Please read the University Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism to understand the penalties associated with academic dishonesty at Carnegie Mellon University. I reserve the right to determine an appropriate penalty based on the violation of academic dishonesty that occurs. The penalty for plagiarizing may range from failure on the specific plagiarized assignment to failure in the class. If you have any questions about this policy as it relates to work you are doing in the course, please feel free to contact the professor.

### Integrity Policies for Open-Ended Creative Projects
For your open-ended, public-facing projects, there are no “correct answers”. Your curiosity, creativity, ingenuity and originality are prized.

You may borrow from other sources, within the limits of “reasonable person” principles described below, provided you attribute your sources. 

As studio art students, you are expected or invited to make extensive use of open-source libraries, tutorials, and freely-distributed code. When working in this way, much like a knitting circle, our classroom is structured around peer instruction, in which students are expected to help each other learn. 

### Use of Free and Open-Source Code in Projects
**Credit is perhaps the most important form of currency** in the economies of commons-based peer production and open-source media arts. You are expected to cite the source of any code you use. Please note the following expectations and guidelines:

**Use Libraries**. In your Projects, the use of reusable libraries is encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name and linking to their repository.

**Be Careful**. It sometimes happens that an artist places the entire source code for their sketch or artwork online, as a resource from which others can learn. The assignments professors give in new-media arts courses are often similar; you may discover the work of a student in some other class or school, who has posted code for a project which responds to a similar assignment. *You should probably avoid this code*. At the very least, you should be very, very careful about approaching such code for possible re-use. If it is necessary to do so, it is best to extract components that solve a specific technical problem, rather than those parts which operate to create a unique experience. Your challenge, if and/or when you work with others’ code, is to *make it your own*. It should be clear that forking an artwork from someone’s page on GitHub or OpenProcessing, and simply changing the colors would be disgracefully lazy. Doing so without proper citation would be plagiarism.

### Policies Regarding Informal Collaboration
Our course places a very high value on civic responsibility that includes, but is not limited to, helping others learn. In this course, I strongly encourage you to give help (or ask others for help) in using various tools, algorithms, libraries, or other facilities. Please note the following expectations:

* In this class, *it’s OK to give and receive help*. In fact, it’s better than OK! Students who receive help from someone else are obliged to acknowledge that person in their project report, clarifying the nature of the help that was received.
* *We are all teachers*. Students with advanced skills are expected to help others, yet refrain from doing another’s work for them. You can usually tell when you’re about to cross the line: Ask yourself whether you are teaching someone to fish, or merely giving them the fish.
* When in doubt: *give credit* to the people who have helped you.

### Policies Regarding Formal Collaboration
The assignments in this course are primarily intended to be executed by individuals. That said, I am in favor of students collaborating if such collaborations arise organically and can be conducted safely. Please note the following expectations:

* *Notify the Professor*. It’s helpful for me to know who is working with whom. Students who wish to collaborate should jointly inform the professor as early as possible.
* *Only pairs*. Unless permission is explicitly granted by the Professor, collaborations in this course are restricted to pairs of students.
* *Describe who did what*. Written reports for collaborative projects should describe how your effort was distributed.
* *Only collaborators from this class and section*. Your project collaborator, if you have one, must be in your section of 60-120, taught by Prof. Golan Levin. You may not collaborate with people in other sections or from outside the course (e.g. your housemate).
* *Avoid co-dependency*. You may not collaborate with the same person (i.e. submit an assignment jointly) on more than two projects.

### Policies Regarding AI Writing Tools
This semester, you will be asked to purposefully explore the *creative* use of AI-powered writing tools, such as ChatGPT. Additionally, however, you will also receive "actual" writing assignments (such as *Looking Outwards* reports, or providing anonymous critical feedback to your peers) where your own thoughts and opinions are requested. These will not be difficult writing assignments. Using AI tools to write these for you represents a bad-faith posture and is not permitted.

# Code of Conduct

### Code of Conduct
I am committed to providing an educational experience that is free of harassment and intimidation for everyone in this course—regardless of gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. I will not tolerate any form of harassment and/or discriminatory, oppressive, suppressive, or violent behavior.

*Harassment* may include, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption, inappropriate or non-consensual physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, and/or refusing to accept the limits or boundaries set by another participant in our classroom. I further define *suppressive* behavior as any sort of communication that stifles or belittles another. Participants who have been asked to stop any behavior are expected to comply immediately. I expect all of the participants in our course community to adhere to this code of conduct–including me, the Professor.

Debate and free exchange of ideas is encouraged, but I will not tolerate harassment. If someone engages in harassing behavior, I may take any action deemed appropriate in the Carnegie Mellon University Policy against [Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-harassment-and-sexual-assault.html), [Discriminatory Harassment](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/community-policies/discriminatory-harassment.html), or other [community policies](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/community-policies/index.html). If you experience or witness harassment, threatening behavior, suppressive behavior, or have any other concerns, I encourage you to speak up, say something, and/or let us know immediately.

*Carnegie Mellon University is firmly committed to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, and respect for the dignity of each individual. Acts of discriminatory harassment or intimidation by a student directed toward any member of the community are inconsistent with this commitment and will not be tolerated. Consistent with the University’s Statement of Assurance, prohibited acts include harassment and intimidation motivated by discriminatory intent based on race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Any such harassment or intimidation of or by a student should be referred to the Dean of Student Affairs for resolution.*

### Inclusivity Statement
It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present activities that accommodate and value a diversity of gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. I will gladly honor your request to address you by the pronouns and name you specify.

### Religious and/or Disability Accommodations
I commit to make individual arrangements to address disabilities and/or religious needs (e.g. religious events in conflict with class meetings). 

If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the Disability Resources office, you are encouraged to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible; I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as best I can. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, you are encouraged to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

# Content Considerations

This course may present content that includes nudity and imagery, language, or dialogue that could offend and/or challenge some students. When possible, the instructor and/or students should make the cohort aware of violent or sexual imagery before it is displayed. Of course, what is challenging to one person may not be challenging to another, and content warnings are culturally and personally subjective in practice. That being said, we may all find moments when we are uncomfortable due to the content of work presented in class. Please do your best to take care of yourself as needed and respect the needs of others when they need to care for themselves. If you have a history of PTSD and require accommodations please let me know and I will do my best to accommodate your specific needs. 

Please note that content considerations will not engage in blanket censorship. In order to best engage in our moment as critical makers and thinkers we will approach a diverse array of work with care and curiosity.


---
# Dealing with Stress

**Take care of yourself**. Please do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of harm to self or others, call someone immediately, day or night:

* **CaPS Counseling: +1-412-268-2922**
* **Re:solve Crisis Network: +1-888-796-8226**
* **On campus CMU Police: +1-412-268-2323**

# COVID-19 Guidelines

### Mask-Wearing
COVID is still circulating widely, evolving quickly, increasingly contagious, and remains a danger to health. For this reason I encourage, recommend, and respectfully request (but cannot legally require) that persons in our classroom wear facial coverings whenever possible. However, in the interest of supporting clear in-person communication, *I feel it is an acceptable risk for a student or professor to temporarily unmask if they are actively giving a presentation or speaking to the entire room*.

This course adheres to [Carnegie Mellon University’s current guidance on COVID-19](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/index.html), which will continue to be updated as the semester approaches, including information about masking, testing and vaccination requirements. Broadly, we plan to operate "in-person" as the semester begins. Students are expected to attend class in-person unless they have been instructed to isolate due to their own positive COVID-19 status.

### Health-Related Absences
Please evaluate your own health status regularly and refrain from attending class and other on-campus events if you feel even slightly unwell. You are emphatically encouraged to seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness. In the event of any contagious illness, please do not come to class or to campus. Instead, notify me by email/Discord about your absence as soon as practical, so that accommodations can be made. Please note that documentation (a Doctor’s note) for medical excuses is *not* required. Likewise, I don't need or want to know intimate details about your medical issues; it is sufficient to let me know that you're unwell. 

### Classroom Streams/Recordings
Students who are unable to attend class in person may request that a session be recorded or streamed over Zoom. *With enough notice*, I will make a good-faith effort to accommodate such requests, particularly for lectures. For non-lecture class sessions (demonstrations, discussions, critiques, workshops, work days), it may be impractical to document the session satisfactorily.

Recordings of class sessions, if they are made, are covered under the *Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act* (FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone outside the course. The purpose of any such recordings, if they are made, is so that students in this course (and only students in this course) can watch or re-watch past class sessions.

# Remote Education

This course is expected to take place *in-person*. However, if it unexpectedly becomes necessary to shift to a remote format, policies in this section will apply. 

### Tools
If it becomes necessary to meet remotely, We will use Zoom for synchronous videoconferencing sessions. Please make sure that your Internet connection, webcam and microphone equipment are set up to use Zoom.

### Videoconferencing Fatigue
Zoom Fatigue is a real and serious problem. To avoid it, in the event of a remote format, we will generally not videoconference for the full 3-hour duration of our class. Instead, we will likely meet for 30-45 minutes. During the rest of class, we may (a) work individually on projects, with videoconferencing available (“quiet co-working”), (b) have one-on-one meetings with the professor, or (c) occasionally convene in small groups.

### Videoconferencing Policies

* Regarding **sharing camera video**: In this course, being able to see one another in Zoom helps to facilitate a better learning environment, create a community, reduce isolation, and promote more engaging discussions. Additionally, seeing your faces REALLY helps me lecture more effectively and responsively. Therefore, our default will be to expect students to have their cameras on during remote lectures and discussions. However: I completely understand there may be technical, privacy, or personal reasons students would not want to have their cameras on. If you have any concerns about sharing your video, please email me as soon as possible and we can discuss possible adjustments. If you would like to hide your camera in general, I ask that you consider a compromise, such as placing scotch tape or a folded ziploc bag over the camera; this helps me know that you're present, while obscuring your details.  
* You are welcome to **use a background image** in your video if you wish. Please keep these images family-friendly and non-distracting.
* In general, please **keep your mic muted** (unless you unless you are actively sharing with the class), in order to reduce stray noise. If you want/need to briefly speak up, you can press the space bar to momentarily unmute.
* You may use the “raise hand feature” to get attention, but for best results, I recommend **actually raising your hand** in the video if possible.
* You are also very welcome to **ask or respond to questions in the Zoom chat panel**; I will do my best to notice and respond to your remarks.
* You are welcome to **use reactions** (clapping and thumbs up), if it feels like the right thing to do.

# Land Notice
Carnegie Mellon University and the city of Pittsburgh are situated on land that has been continuously inhabited for over 16,000 years, serving as a home to members of the Adena, Hopewell, Monongahela, Lenape, Shawnee, Wyandot, Tisagechroami, Delaware, and Mohican communities before becoming a territory of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Iroquois Confederacy included the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora people, whose relationships with the land continue to this day. The Seneca name for Pittsburgh is [Dionde:gâ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Pittsburgh).
