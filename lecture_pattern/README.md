# Pattern and Visual Rhythm

> *Making procedural patterns is a mental exercise in finding minimal reusable elements. This practice is old; we as a species have been using grids and patterns to decorate textiles, floors and borders of objects for a long time: from meander patterns in ancient Greece, to Chinese lattice design, the pleasure of repetition and variation catches our imagination. Take some time to look at decorative patterns and see how artists and designers have a long history of navigating the fine edge between the predictability of order and the surprise of variation and chaos. From Arabic geometrical patterns, to gorgeous African fabric designs, there is an entire universe of patterns to learn from.* — From "The Book of Shaders" by Patricio Gonzalez-Vivo.

From Casey Reas et al., "Form+Code": 

> *Repetition can have a powerful effect on the human body and psyche. One of the most extreme examples is the way a rapidly flashing light can trigger a seizure. A more universal example is how the beat of a good song will inspire people to dance along. In a similar way, dynamic visual patterns can appear, in subtle ways, to vibrate physically. Within the visual realm, repetition encourages our eyes to dance. Controlling repetition is a way to choreograph human eye movement. There are many examples of artworks that modulate repetition to create strong sensations of depth and motion.*

Pattern is the starting point from which we perceive and impose order in the world. Examples of functional, decorative, and expressive pattern-making date from ancient times and take many forms, including calendars, mosaics, tapestry, quilting, jewelry, calligraphy, furniture, and architecture. There is an intimate connection between pattern design, visual rhythm, geometry, mathematics, and iterative algorithms. This week, you are invited to expand your understanding of these relationships in formal terms.

In the mid-19th century, colonialist Europeans scholars "discovered" the design languages of the rest of the world. Two highly influential and lavishly printed books published in France and England compiled and popularized collections of designs from Asia and the Middle East: Albert Racinet’s [*L’Ornement Polychrome*](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/albert-racinet-s-l-ornement-polychrome-1869-73/) (1869–73), and [*The Grammar of Ornament*](https://archive.org/details/grammarornament00Jone) (1856) by Owen Jones:

Repetitive visual patterns play a huge role in vernacular decorative arts. For a fun example, check out the fantastic [*Historic New England Wallpaper Archive*](https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/wallpaper/), which has more than 6000 high-resolution scans of antique wallpapers:

### Pattern and Mathematics

Mathematicians have studied the logic of patterns for decades. Did you know that there are only and exactly [17 types of 2D crystallographic (wallpaper) symmetries](https://blog.artlandia.com/the-simplest-diagram-of-the-17-symmetry-types-ever/). (There are no others!) You can draw the 17 wallpaper symmetries interactively at [**https://eschersket.ch**](https://eschersket.ch/).

Recently, scholarly reconsiderations of indigenous patterns have made plain their rigorous use of mathematics. The book [*African Fractals: modern computing and indigenous design*](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991019840889704436&context=L&vid=01CMU_INST:01CMU&lang=en&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,African%20Fractals&mode=Basic) by Ron Eglash is an example, presenting works such as this self-similar (fractal) design in a Fulani wedding blanket:

### Pattern in Modernism: Anni Albers and Bridget Riley

Anni Albers was one of the most influential textile designers of the 20th century. In the early 1930s, she was the director of the textiles studio in the German Bauhaus school; in 1949, she became the first textile designer to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Her work reveals a stunning sensibility for rhythm, color, and punctuation and helped define visual Modernism in textile art. 

Anni Albers in her studio.

Anni Albers, *Pasture* (1958). 

![Anni Albers, *Pasture*](img/anni_albers_pasture_1958.jpg)

Textile arts such as weaving, knitting, and needlepoint are ancient cultural practices of pixel logic. In works like *South of The Border* (1958, shown here in detail), Anni Albers used ingenious combinations of threads to produce custom pixels:

![Anni Albers, *South of The Border*](img/anni_albers_south_of_the_border_closeup.jpg)

Anni Albers, *Fox II* (1972), silkscreen. Later in life, Albers developed a strong interest in lithography.

![Anni Albers, *Fox II*](img/anni_albers_fox_II_1972.jpg)

Optical art (often shortened to "Op Art") is a term used since the early 1960s to describe artworks that induce retinal phenomena, including vibration, flashing, swelling, and warping. Though their works were created without the aid of computers, many Op Artists relied on the use of algorithms, in the form of (analog) procedural design and mathematical calculations. 

[*The Responsive Eye*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek_lQJsU41U&t=9s) (video) was an influential exhibition of Op Art (and in a sense, interactive art) at MoMA in 1965:

[![The Responsive Eye, MoMA exhibition 1965](img/responsive_eye.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek_lQJsU41U&t=9s)

Born in London in 1931, Bridget Riley emerged onto the art scene in the 1960s with a series of abstract black and white geometric paintings. Her work *Currents* (1964) can be seen at left in the still above. In 1968, she became the first British artist and the first woman to win the Venice Biennale's International Prize for Painting.

![Bridget Riley](img/riley_in_studio.jpg)

Riley's Shift (1963):

![Bridget Riley, *Shift*, 1963](img/riley_shift_1963.png)

*Untitled [Fragment 3/11]*, Bridget Riley, 1965:

![Bridget Riley, *Fragment 3*, 1963](img/bridget_riley_fragment_3_1965.jpg)

Riley created many iconic Op Art paintings, involving patterns developed with hand-computed curves. Her *Cataract 3* (1967) work shows a complete mastery of the effects that are characteristic of Op Art: in particular, subtle variations in the size, shape, or placement of serialized units in the overall pattern.

### Pattern on the Computer

The computer's abilities to (1) compute mathematics, (2) iterate tirelessly, and (3) generate randomness make it an ideal tool for the exploration of patterning. Here's Vera Molnár's *Square Structures* (1974). Starting in 1968, Molnár was among the first artists to use a computer. Her 1974 plotter drawing demonstrates patterns arising from the interaction between procedural iteration and randomized omission.

![Vera Molnár's *Square Structures*](img/molnar_computer_drawing.jpg)

Another pioneer of early computer art, Manfred Mohr, [wrote plotter programs in the late 1960s](http://www.emohr.com/two_1969.html) to generate patterns (comprised of repeated elements) that resembled writing. For this project, P-021/A+B (1969), the generative rule is: 

> "*The elements are horizontal, vertical, 45 degree lines, square waves, zig-zags, and have probabilities for line widths and lengths. The algorithm places elements in a horizontal direction and has a high probability to move from left to right and a limited probability to backtrack. The original idea of this algorithm was to create a visual musical score which defies the progression in time by occasionally turning back on itself. Thus at the same time an abstract text is created.*"

![Manfred Mohr's *P-021/A+B*](img/manfred_mohr_p021a.gif)

Mark Wilson began developing patterned computer-generated plotter works in the early 1980s. His *PSC-31* (2003) is shown below left, and in detail: 

![Mark Wilson, *PSC-31*, 2003](img/mark_wilson_psc31.jpg)

Here's a grab bag of other works that use computation to make patterns.

Casey Reas has created patterns by rearranging the pixels of video streams. The [results](https://www.vice.com/en/article/9an9da/casey-reas-launches-new-exhibition-at-bitforms-gallery) have a very organic color scheme.

![Casey Reas](img/reas_pill_a_day_onethird.jpg) 

Other [computational works](https://reas.com/hsb/) (on paper) by Reas make minute positional changes in small monochromatic elements to produce complex patterns:

![Casey Reas](img/reas_hsb_1.jpg) 

Kim Asendorf's [*Monogrid.xyz*](https://monogrid.xyz/) (2021) is a masterpiece of dynamic monochromatic computational pattern design:

![Kim Asendorf's *Monogrid.xyz*](img/kim_asendorf_monogrid.gif) 

Andreas Gysin has made a variety of works that present grids of computed ASCII characters: 

![Andreas Gysin](img/gysin.gif) 

Take Gysin's [*ASCII PLAY*](https://play.ertdfgcvb.xyz) project for a spin.

Computationally designed patterns can be output to media other than screen and paper. Leah Buechley explores the intersection of computation and craft. The pattern in her *lasercut curtain* (2017), computationally generated in Processing, features multiple forms of iteration and controlled randomness: 

![Leah Buechley, *lasercut curtain*](img/buechley_curtain_tallhalf.jpg) 

Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg's [*Patchwork Amoeba Puzzle* (2012)](https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/shop/product.php?code=363), plywood, is a computer-generated and digitally-fabricated wooden design derived from a computer simulation of differential growth, similar to how the sutures of skull bones are formed.

![Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg's *Patchwork Amoeba Puzzle*](img/nervous.jpg)

In a return to the roots of computation itself, the (now-defunct) Swiss Museum of Digital Art commissioned the creation of a computationally-generated, unique-per-customer [algorithmically knit sweatshirt](https://muda.co/sweatshirt/) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyrgF1M1OxY))

[![Algorithmic sweatshirt](img/muda_sweatshirt.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyrgF1M1OxY)

Spanish artist Galo Canizares has been creating his own Arduino-powered e-ink computers (2023) to display generative patterns at an intimate scale and form factor. The use of e-Ink (like a Kindle screen) makes for very low-power devices:

![Galo Canizares](img/itsgalo_epaper.png)

Swiss software artist Leander Herzog has made a terminal program, *Agglo* (2023) that uses colored text blocks to create an endless stream of generative pattern:

* ssh agglo@agglo.leanderherzog.ch
* (password: agglo)

## Randomness and Order

The exploration of the relationship between chaos and order has been an abiding theme in computer-based generative art. Consider this classic work by Georg Nees, *Schotter* (“Gravel”, 1968), [in the collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O221321/schotter-print-nees-georg/), London. (Nees was the first person to ever publicly exhibit artwork created with a digital computer, in 1965.)

![Schotter](img/nees_schotter.jpg)

* Which visual properties of the squares is Nees manipulating in order to achieve disorder?
* To perceive disorder, it helps to see it *in contrast with order*. How is that contrast established in *Schotter*? (*hint*: gradient...)

Paul Rickards is an artist and retrocomputing enthusiast currently active on #PlotterTwitter. In September 2016 he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/paulrickards/status/780057031566917632) this small study, “Grid of imperfect circles”:

![Rickards imperfect circles](img/rickards.jpg)

* Attempt to describe the algorithm which (you guess) produced this work.
* To the extent that this artwork is interesting, *what makes it so*? (Can you imagine this work without the imperfections in the circles?)
* How is *disorder* achieved in this work? (*hint*: fighting against a grid...)
* Do you think the circles are intended to look “hand drawn”?) 

Here's a recent photo of computer art pioneer Vera Molnár, standing in front of one of her generative artworks:

![Vera Molnar](img/vera_photo.jpg)

* In what way is this image *ordered*?
* In what way is this image *disordered*?

Too little variation, and the image is boring; too much randomness, and it's "just noise". The question is, how much randomness is enough, or just right? Information theoreticians call this the Wundt curve: 

![Order-Disorder](img/order_disorder.jpg)

## Truchet & Related Patternmaking

### Modular Elements, Randomized; Larger Structures Seemingly Emerging Therefrom

![truchet_triangular_tiles_800.gif](img/truchet_triangular_tiles_800.gif)

In 1704, the Dominican friar Sebastien Truchet considered the range of possible patterns formed by tilings of right triangles oriented at the four corners of a square.

```

Processing (Java):

```
for (int i=0; i<1000000; i++){
  print ((char)(random(1)<0.5? 47:92));
}
```

JavaScript in HTML (paste into URL bar!):

```
data:text/html,<div style="line-height:1em;word-wrap:break-word;"id=d><script>for(i=0;1e4>i;i++)d.innerHTML+=String.fromCharCode(9585+Math.random()*2);</script>
```

p5.js ([sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/QskmgK4Wl))

```
function setup() {
  let output = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < 2000; i++) {
    if (random(0, 1) < 0.5) {
      output += "⟍";
    } else {
      output += "⟋";
    }
  }
  print(output); 
}
```
OR

  var count = 20;
  for (var j = 1; j <= count; j++) {
    for (var i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
      var cx = i * 20;
      var cy = j * 20;
      
      if (random(0, 1) < 0.5) {
        line(cx, cy, cx + 20, cy + 20);
      } else {
        line(cx, cy + 20, cx + 20, cy);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A modification of Truchet’s tiles ("**Smith tiles**") leads to a single tile consisting of two circular arcs of radius equal to half the tile edge length centered at opposed corners. There are two possible orientations of this tile, and tiling the plane using tiles with random orientations gives visually interesting patterns.
